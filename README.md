# This repository contains all task assigned for Recursion algorithm programing

To check if a word is a palindrome in JavaScript using counters and loops, you can follow this algorithm:

a. Initialize two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the word (left pointer) and the other starting from the end of the word (right pointer).

b. Loop while the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer.

c. Compare the characters at the left pointer and right pointer positions.

d. If the characters are equal, move both pointers towards each other (left pointer forward and right pointer backward).

e. If the characters are different, the word is not a palindrome, and you can return false.

f. After the loop, if the left pointer becomes greater than the right pointer, it means the word is a palindrome, and you can return true.
